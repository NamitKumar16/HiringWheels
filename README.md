# HiringWheels

Spring Boot Project – HiringWheels App 
 
## Project Outline 
As part of this project, you will create the backend for the web application for a car rental application 
named ‘HiringWheels’. 
 
## Features of the Project 
Types of users 
 
Each user registered on the application can have either of the following two roles.  
 
• USER: Users with this role are regular customers who wish to book a vehicle from the 
application.  
• ADMIN: Users with this role serve as administrators for the application. 
▪ Admins can add new vehicles to the application. 
▪ Admins can change the availability of registered vehicles. 
 
Note:  The  following  workflows  are  to  help  you  understand  how  the  larger  project  would  work.  Few  of 
these features might be out of scope at this point, however, once you have completed few checkpoints, 
you shall be able to understand fully how these features come into the picture. 
 
Workflows common for both ‘ADMIN’ and ‘USER’ 
• Login: This feature would allow users to log in to the application to continue ahead with vehicle 
booking.  
Workflows for ‘USER’ 
• Signup: This feature would allow users to register themselves on the web application. Users 
must register themselves on the application if they wish to book vehicles. 
• Vehicle Booking: This feature would allow users to book vehicles according to their 
requirements.  
Note: You will be required to register users with the ‘ADMIN’ role from the backend. 
 
 
 
Workflows for ‘ADMIN’ 
 
• Vehicle Registration: This feature would allow users with the ‘ADMIN’ role to add vehicles to the 
portal. While registering vehicles, the Admin maps each vehicle to a location. This essentially 
means that a particular vehicle will only be available for a particular pickup location.  
• Change Vehicle Availability: This feature would allow users with the ‘ADMIN’ role to change the 
availability of vehicles. For example, the Admin has the right to make a registered vehicle 
unavailable for booking in cases where vehicles are not available for booking.
